# Inspiration
Creators today are their own businesses. However, full time content creators often struggle with accessing credit since many of them are not considered to have a steady standard income. As a result many struggle with getting approved for financial services such as a mortgage for their house, a loan for their supplies, or even a credit card in some cases. A personal or small business loan is attainable from a bank generally if the customer is an existing customer, and with good credit. Additionally, the ability to pay back a loan is greatly empathized so knowing the customer’s income is very important.

So how can creators prove to the bank that they can earn a steady income?
